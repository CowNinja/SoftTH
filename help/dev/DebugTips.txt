On Windows 10, activating the DX11 Debug layer is not as simple as installing the SDK (it's not in the Win 10 SDK).

    Settings panel -> System -> Apps & features -> Manage optional Features -> Add a feature -> Select "Graphics Tools"

I use VC2005 Express with C::B, partly because the MSVC debugger is quite good. I have found the easiest is to make a global variable in C::B called VC2005IDE which points to the install dir of VC2005 Express in my case.

Then I configure a tool in the Tools menu

Name: VC2005 Debug
Executable: $(#VC2005IDE)\VCExpress.exe
Parameters: /debugexe ${TARGET_OUTPUT_FILE}
Working directory: ${TARGET_OUTPUT_DIR}
check the option "Launch tool visible detached"

So while I edit/compile/build in C::B, this simple fix launches the VC2005 Express for debugging when needed. Notice that you don't need a VS project/solution to do this.
